// * (Restore objects from a file) Suppose a file named Exercise17_07.dat has been  *
// * created using the ObjectOutputStream. The file contains Loan objects. The Loan *
// * class in Listing 10.2 does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the Loan class  *
// * to implement Serializable. Write a program that reads the Loan objects from    *
// * the file and displays the total loan amount. Suppose you donâ€™t know how many   *
// * Loan objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.          *
